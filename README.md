Home-with-ReasoN

I use Google firebase on the backend to connect multiple devices at home. 
I also made the code for an ESP8266 to be able to interact with the firebase.

In this small demo I turn on a green led which is connected to an ESP8266 by speaking to a google home microphone which is also connected to my home Wi-fi.
